## Task: Verify CLI runs: `go run main.go --help` should show help text

### Completed Work:

1. **Initialized Go module**: Created go.mod with module name `github.com/zkwentz/amazon-cli`

2. **Installed dependencies**: Added Cobra v1.10.2 and Viper v1.21.0 for CLI framework

3. **Created directory structure**: Set up the project structure with cmd/, internal/, and pkg/ directories

4. **Implemented cmd/root.go**:
   - Created root command with proper Use, Short, and Long descriptions
   - Added all persistent flags: --output, --quiet, --verbose, --config, --no-color
   - Implemented Viper configuration binding
   - Set up config file loading from ~/.amazon-cli/config.json

5. **Implemented cmd/version.go**: Created version command that displays version, commit, and build date

6. **Created main.go**: Entry point that executes the root command

### Verification:

Successfully tested CLI functionality:
- `go run main.go --help` displays comprehensive help text with all commands and flags
- `go run main.go version` shows version information
- `go run main.go` (without args) displays the same help text as --help flag

### Files Created:
- main.go
- cmd/root.go
- cmd/version.go
- go.mod
- go.sum

### Files Modified:
- None (initial implementation)

The CLI now properly runs and displays help text as required by the task.
