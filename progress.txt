## Completed: Write tests for dry run vs confirmed behavior

Created comprehensive test suite for dry run vs confirmed behavior in ralphy.sh.

**What was implemented:**
- Created test_dry_run.sh with 13 test cases covering all aspects of dry-run functionality
- Tests verify that --dry-run flag prevents actual execution
- Tests confirm dry run shows what would be executed without making changes
- Tests validate no files are modified in dry run mode
- Tests ensure normal mode (without --dry-run) executes tasks correctly
- Tests check proper flag parsing and cleanup behavior
- Tests verify compatibility with other flags (--parallel, --branch-per-task, --max-iterations)
- All 17 assertions passing (13 test functions with some having multiple assertions)

**Test Coverage:**
1. Execution prevention in dry run mode
2. Dry run output formatting
3. File system immutability during dry run
4. Git state preservation in dry run
5. Normal vs dry run behavior comparison
6. Command line flag parsing
7. Temporary file cleanup
8. Exit codes
9. AI engine invocation prevention
10. Compatibility with parallel execution
11. Branch creation prevention

**Files created:**
- test_dry_run.sh (executable test suite with colored output)

The test suite is fully functional and can be run with: ./test_dry_run.sh
