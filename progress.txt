## Task: Implement GetProductReviews(asin string, limit int) (*ReviewsResponse, error)

### What was implemented:

1. **Created pkg/models/product.go**
   - Added `Product` struct with all required fields (ASIN, Title, Price, Rating, etc.)
   - Added `SearchResponse` struct for product search results
   - Added `Review` struct for individual product reviews
   - Added `ReviewsResponse` struct for reviews API response

2. **Implemented internal/amazon/product.go**
   - Implemented `GetProduct(asin string) (*models.Product, error)` - fetches detailed product information
   - Implemented `GetProductReviews(asin string, limit int) (*models.ReviewsResponse, error)` - fetches product reviews
   - Added helper functions:
     - `isValidASIN(asin string) bool` - validates ASIN format
     - `parsePrice(priceStr string) float64` - parses price strings
     - `parseRating(ratingStr string) float64` - parses rating text
     - `parseStarRating(classStr string) float64` - parses star rating from CSS classes
     - `parseReviewCount(countStr string) int` - parses review count
   - Implemented `Get(url string)` and `Do(req *http.Request)` methods with rate limiting support
   - Added stub Client and RateLimiter types for compilation

3. **Created comprehensive test suite (internal/amazon/product_test.go)**
   - Tests for `GetProductReviews` with various scenarios:
     - Valid reviews with limit
     - No limit returns all reviews
     - Invalid ASIN format
     - Product not found (404)
     - No reviews available
     - Network errors
     - Rate limiting behavior
   - Unit tests for helper functions:
     - `TestParseRating` - tests rating parsing
     - `TestParseStarRating` - tests star rating parsing
     - `TestParseReviewCount` - tests review count parsing
     - `TestIsValidASIN` - tests ASIN validation
   - Implemented mock HTTP transport for testing (`mockRoundTripper`, `errorRoundTripper`)
   - All tests passing successfully

4. **Updated dependencies**
   - Added `github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery` for HTML parsing
   - Added `github.com/andybalholm/cascadia` (goquery dependency)
   - Added `golang.org/x/net` (goquery dependency)

### Implementation details:

The `GetProductReviews` function:
- Validates ASIN format (must be 10 alphanumeric characters)
- Fetches reviews from `https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/{asin}`
- Parses HTML using goquery to extract:
  - Average rating from the page
  - Total review count
  - Individual reviews (rating, title, body, author, date, verified status)
- Respects the limit parameter to return only requested number of reviews
- Includes proper error handling for network errors, invalid ASINs, and HTTP errors
- Uses rate limiting to avoid triggering Amazon's anti-automation measures

### Test coverage:
- 7 test functions covering main functionality and edge cases
- All tests passing (100% success rate)
- Tests use mock HTTP servers and transports for reliable testing
