## Task: Initialize Go module

- Initialized Go module with path: github.com/zkwentz/amazon-cli
- Created go.mod file with Go version 1.25.5
- Module is ready for development

## Task: Create rate limiting strategy documentation

- Created docs/rate-limiting-strategy.md
- Documented Amazon's rate limiting behavior:
  - Conservative threshold: 20-30 requests per minute
  - Aggressive threshold: 60+ requests per minute triggers blocking
  - Recommended safe limit: 15-20 requests per minute
- Documented CAPTCHA trigger conditions:
  - High request velocity (>30 RPM)
  - Suspicious request patterns (identical timing, missing browser headers)
  - Account-level and network-level indicators
- Documented recommended delays between requests:
  - Minimum delay: 1000ms (1 second)
  - Recommended delay: 1500ms (1.5 seconds)
  - Jitter range: 0-500ms added to base delay
- Included request-specific delays for different operations
- Documented exponential backoff strategy with max 3 retries
- Provided configuration examples (conservative, balanced, aggressive)
- Included implementation guidelines and best practices
