Task: Test frequency change validation

Implementation Summary:
========================

1. Created subscription data models (pkg/models/subscription.go):
   - Subscription struct with all required fields
   - SubscriptionsResponse and UpcomingDelivery structs

2. Created error handling models (pkg/models/errors.go):
   - CLIError struct with Code, Message, and Details fields
   - Error code constants as defined in PRD
   - Proper error interface implementation

3. Implemented subscription API client (internal/amazon/subscriptions.go):
   - SubscriptionClient with UpdateFrequency method
   - Comprehensive frequency validation logic:
     * Validates subscription ID is not empty
     * Validates frequency is >= 1 week (minimum)
     * Validates frequency is <= 26 weeks (maximum)
     * Validates frequency matches Amazon's supported intervals: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 26] weeks
   - IsValidFrequency helper function for checking valid intervals
   - Additional subscription methods: GetSubscriptions, GetSubscription, SkipDelivery, CancelSubscription, GetUpcomingDeliveries

4. Comprehensive test coverage (internal/amazon/subscriptions_test.go):
   - TestIsValidFrequency: Tests all valid and invalid frequency values
   - TestUpdateFrequency_Success: Tests successful frequency updates for all valid intervals
   - TestUpdateFrequency_EmptySubscriptionID: Tests validation of empty subscription ID
   - TestUpdateFrequency_FrequencyTooLow: Tests handling of frequencies below minimum (0, -1, -10)
   - TestUpdateFrequency_FrequencyTooHigh: Tests handling of frequencies above maximum (27, 30, 52, 100)
   - TestUpdateFrequency_InvalidFrequencyInterval: Tests rejection of unsupported intervals (7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25)
   - TestUpdateFrequency_BoundaryConditions: Tests exact boundary values (0, 1, 26, 27)
   - TestUpdateFrequency_AllValidFrequencies: Verifies all valid frequencies work
   - Additional tests for other subscription methods

Test Results:
=============
All tests passing (21 test functions, 70+ test cases total)
- Validates frequency range (1-26 weeks as per PRD)
- Validates frequency matches Amazon's supported intervals
- Proper error handling with structured CLIError responses
- Error messages include helpful details (provided_weeks, valid_frequencies, min/max)
