## Completed Tasks

### pkg/models/product.go - Product Models Implementation

**Date:** 2026-01-18

**Summary:**
Created the complete product models package with all required structs for handling Amazon product data in the CLI.

**Files Created:**
- `pkg/models/product.go` - Core product model definitions
- `pkg/models/product_test.go` - Comprehensive test suite for product models

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Product Struct:**
   - ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number)
   - Title, Price, OriginalPrice (for discounts)
   - Rating, ReviewCount
   - Prime eligibility flag
   - InStock status
   - DeliveryEstimate
   - Optional fields: Description, Features, Images

2. **SearchResponse Struct:**
   - Query string
   - Results array of Product structs
   - TotalResults count
   - Page number for pagination

3. **Review Struct:**
   - Rating, Title, Body
   - Author, Date
   - Verified purchase flag

4. **ReviewsResponse Struct:**
   - ASIN
   - Reviews array
   - AverageRating, TotalReviews

**Test Coverage:**
- JSON marshaling/unmarshaling for all structs
- Optional field handling (omitempty behavior)
- Empty search results handling
- All tests passing (ok  	github.com/zkwentz/amazon-cli/pkg/models	0.370s)

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used pointer for OriginalPrice to properly represent nil when no discount exists
- Applied omitempty tags to optional fields to keep JSON output clean
- Followed Go best practices for JSON struct tags
- Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases

This implementation aligns with Phase 5.1 of the PRD and provides the foundation for search and product commands.
