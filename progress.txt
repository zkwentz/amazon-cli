## Phase 1.2 Progress - Cobra CLI Framework Setup

### Completed Tasks:
- Created `cmd/version.go` - Simple version command that prints version information
  - Displays version string, commit hash, and build date
  - Version variables designed to be set via ldflags during build
  - Follows Cobra command pattern with proper initialization

- Created `cmd/version_test.go` - Unit tests for version command
  - Tests version command output format
  - Tests that all expected strings are present in output
  - Tests that version variables exist and have default values

### Files Created:
- cmd/version.go - Version command implementation
- cmd/version_test.go - Test coverage for version command

### Technical Details:
- Version command uses three variables (version, commit, date) with defaults
- Variables can be overridden at build time using ldflags
- Command registered with rootCmd in init() function
- Output format: "amazon-cli version X.X.X\ncommit: <hash>\nbuilt: <date>"

### Next Steps (from PRD):
- Wire up main.go to execute root command
- Verify CLI runs with `go run main.go --help`
