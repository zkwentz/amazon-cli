## Completed Tasks

### HTTP Client Foundation - Get Method Implementation
- Created directory structure for the project (internal/amazon, internal/config, internal/ratelimit, pkg/models)
- Initialized Go module: github.com/zkwentz/amazon-cli
- Implemented rate limiter (internal/ratelimit/limiter.go):
  - RateLimiter struct with Wait(), WaitWithBackoff(), and ShouldRetry() methods
  - Configurable min/max delays and max retries
  - Random jitter (0-500ms) for request spacing
  - Exponential backoff for retry attempts
- Implemented configuration management (internal/config/config.go):
  - Config struct with Auth, Defaults, and RateLimiting sections
  - LoadConfig() and SaveConfig() functions
  - Default configuration with 1000ms min delay, 3 max retries
- Implemented HTTP client (internal/amazon/client.go):
  - Client struct with http.Client, RateLimiter, and config
  - User-Agent rotation (10 common browser user agents)
  - Do() method with rate limiting and retry logic for 429/503 responses
  - **Get(url string) (*http.Response, error)** convenience method ✓
- Comprehensive test suite (internal/amazon/client_test.go):
  - Tests for successful GET requests
  - Tests for HTTP error status codes (404, 500)
  - Tests for invalid URLs
  - Tests for User-Agent rotation
  - Tests for retry logic on 429 (rate limited) responses
  - Tests for retry logic on 503 (service unavailable) responses
  - Tests for max retries exceeded scenario
  - All tests passing ✓

The Get() method provides a simple interface for making GET requests that automatically:
- Applies rate limiting with jitter
- Rotates User-Agent headers
- Sets common browser headers
- Retries on 429/503 with exponential backoff
- Returns the final http.Response or error
