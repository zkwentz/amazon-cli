# Amazon CLI - Development Progress

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1.1.4: Create initial `main.go` entry point
- Created `main.go` with initial entry point implementation
- Includes version information variables (version, commit, date) for build-time injection
- Implements `--version` / `-v` flag to display version information
- Displays helpful usage information showing planned command structure:
  - auth (login, status, logout)
  - orders (list, get, track, history)
  - returns (list, options, create, label, status)
  - search
  - product (get, reviews)
  - cart (add, list, remove, clear, checkout)
  - buy
  - subscriptions (list, get, skip, frequency, cancel, upcoming)
- Ready to be integrated with Cobra framework in subsequent tasks
- Tested and verified working with `go run main.go` and `go run main.go --version`

### Next Steps
- Initialize Go module with `go mod init github.com/zkwentz/amazon-cli`
- Install and set up Cobra CLI framework
