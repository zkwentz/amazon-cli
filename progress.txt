## Completed Tasks

### ShouldRetry Function Implementation
- Created internal/ratelimit directory structure
- Implemented `ShouldRetry(statusCode int, attempt int) bool` function in internal/ratelimit/limiter.go
  - Returns true for HTTP status codes 429 (rate limited) and 503 (service unavailable)
  - Returns false if attempt >= MaxRetries
  - Returns false for all other status codes
- Implemented complete RateLimiter struct with supporting functions:
  - `NewRateLimiter(config RateLimitConfig) *RateLimiter` - constructor
  - `Wait() error` - enforces minimum delay between requests with jitter
  - `WaitWithBackoff(attempt int) error` - exponential backoff (2^attempt * 1000ms, max 60s)
  - `ShouldRetry(statusCode int, attempt int) bool` - retry decision logic
- Created comprehensive test suite in internal/ratelimit/limiter_test.go
  - 13 test cases for ShouldRetry covering various scenarios
  - Tests for 429 and 503 status codes with different attempt counts
  - Tests for non-retryable status codes (200, 401, 404, 500)
  - Tests for edge cases (max retries = 0, 1, attempt at boundary)
  - Tests for NewRateLimiter, Wait, and WaitWithBackoff functions
- All tests pass successfully (75.953s execution time for full test suite)
- Initialized Go module: github.com/zkwentz/amazon-cli
