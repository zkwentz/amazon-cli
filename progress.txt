# Progress Log

## 2026-01-18: Implemented `cart list` command

### What was implemented:
1. Created `cmd/cart.go` with cart parent command and cart list subcommand
   - Implemented `cart` parent command with description and help text
   - Implemented `cart list` subcommand that retrieves and displays cart contents
   - Command outputs JSON format with proper indentation for readability
   - Integration with existing `internal/amazon` Client.GetCart() method

2. Created comprehensive test suite in `cmd/cart_test.go`
   - TestCartListCommand: Verifies command executes successfully and returns valid cart JSON
   - TestCartListCommandJSONFormat: Validates JSON output contains all required fields
   - TestCartCommandExists: Verifies command structure and properties
   - TestCartListCommandOutput: Validates output structure and field presence
   - All tests passing successfully

### Features:
- Command: `amazon-cli cart list`
- Output format: JSON with indentation
- Returns complete cart information:
  - items: Array of cart items (ASIN, title, price, quantity, subtotal, prime, in_stock)
  - subtotal: Cart subtotal
  - estimated_tax: Estimated tax amount
  - total: Total amount including tax
  - item_count: Total number of items in cart

### Testing:
- All unit tests pass (4/4 tests)
- Command builds successfully
- Manual testing confirms correct JSON output
- Help text displays correctly for both `cart` and `cart list` commands

### Files modified/created:
- cmd/cart.go (new)
- cmd/cart_test.go (new)

### Next steps:
This implementation provides the foundation for additional cart commands:
- cart add <asin>
- cart remove <asin>
- cart clear
- cart checkout
