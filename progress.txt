# Amazon CLI - Development Progress

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Implemented `orders list` command
- Created Go module and project structure
- Set up Cobra CLI framework with root command
- Created data models for orders (Order, OrderItem, Tracking, OrdersResponse)
- Created error models (CLIError, ErrorResponse) with error codes
- Implemented output system for JSON formatting
- Implemented Amazon client with orders functionality
- Created `orders list` command with the following features:
  - `--limit` flag to limit number of orders (default: 10)
  - `--status` flag to filter by status (pending, delivered, returned)
  - JSON output matching the PRD schema
  - Help documentation with usage examples
- Wrote comprehensive tests:
  - Orders API tests (filtering, limiting, structure validation)
  - Model JSON serialization tests
  - All tests passing

### Technical Details
- Files created:
  - `main.go` - entry point
  - `cmd/root.go` - root CLI command with global flags
  - `cmd/orders.go` - orders command group and list subcommand
  - `pkg/models/order.go` - order data models
  - `pkg/models/errors.go` - error handling models
  - `internal/output/output.go` - output formatting system
  - `internal/amazon/client.go` - Amazon HTTP client
  - `internal/amazon/orders.go` - orders API implementation (mock data)
  - `internal/amazon/orders_test.go` - orders API tests
  - `pkg/models/order_test.go` - model tests
  - `.gitignore` - ignore patterns for build artifacts
  - `go.mod` - Go module dependencies

### Command Usage
```bash
# List all orders
amazon-cli orders list

# List with limit
amazon-cli orders list --limit 5

# Filter by status
amazon-cli orders list --status delivered

# Combine filters
amazon-cli orders list --limit 10 --status pending
```

### Next Steps
The `orders list` command is fully functional with a mock implementation. The next phase would be to:
1. Implement actual Amazon API/scraping logic in `internal/amazon/orders.go`
2. Add authentication system
3. Implement other order commands (get, track, history)
4. Continue with other features from the PRD
