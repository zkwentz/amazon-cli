## Task: Test price range filtering

### Completed Implementation:

1. **Go Module Setup**
   - Initialized Go module: github.com/zkwentz/amazon-cli
   - Created project directory structure (pkg/models, internal/amazon)

2. **Product Data Models** (pkg/models/product.go)
   - Implemented Product struct with all required fields (ASIN, Title, Price, etc.)
   - Implemented SearchResponse struct for search results
   - Implemented SearchOptions struct with MinPrice, MaxPrice, PrimeOnly, and other filters

3. **Search Functionality** (internal/amazon/search.go)
   - Implemented Search() function with price range filtering
   - Implemented filterByPriceRange() function that handles:
     - Min price only filtering
     - Max price only filtering
     - Both min and max price filtering
     - No price filtering (returns all products)
   - Implemented filterByPrime() function for Prime-eligible filtering
   - Added mock product data for testing purposes

4. **Comprehensive Test Suite** (internal/amazon/search_test.go)
   - TestSearch: 10 test cases covering:
     - Empty query validation
     - No price filters (returns all)
     - Min price only filtering
     - Max price only filtering
     - Both min and max price filtering
     - Narrow price range filtering
     - Price range excluding all products
     - Exact price match
     - Prime-only filtering
     - Combined price range and Prime filtering

   - TestFilterByPriceRange: 6 test cases covering:
     - No filters
     - Min price only
     - Max price only
     - Both filters
     - No matches
     - Exact price match

   - TestFilterByPrime: Validates Prime-eligible filtering

   - TestPriceRangeEdgeCases: 4 edge case tests covering:
     - Very low prices (cents)
     - Very high prices
     - Boundary conditions (min equals price, max equals price)

### Test Results:
All 21 tests passed successfully:
- TestSearch: 10/10 passed
- TestFilterByPriceRange: 6/6 passed
- TestFilterByPrime: 1/1 passed
- TestPriceRangeEdgeCases: 4/4 passed

### Implementation Notes:
- Price range filtering logic correctly handles inclusive boundaries (>= minPrice, <= maxPrice)
- Empty price values (0 or negative) are treated as "no filter"
- Filters can be combined (price range + Prime filtering)
- Edge cases like exact price matches and boundary values are properly handled
- Test coverage includes positive cases, negative cases, and edge cases
