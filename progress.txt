## Progress Update - Orders Command Implementation

### Task: Create cmd/orders.go

#### What was implemented:

1. **Created cmd/orders.go** - Implemented the complete orders command structure with all subcommands:
   - `orders list` - List recent orders with filtering
     - Added `--limit` flag (default: 10) to control number of results
     - Added `--status` flag to filter by order status (pending, delivered, returned)
   - `orders get <order-id>` - Get detailed information about a specific order
   - `orders track <order-id>` - Get tracking information for an order
   - `orders history` - Get extended order history
     - Added `--year` flag to filter by specific year
     - Added `--format` flag for output format control

2. **Created cmd/orders_test.go** - Comprehensive test suite with 14 test cases:
   - Test basic list command functionality
   - Test list command with limit flag
   - Test list command with status flag
   - Test get command with valid order ID
   - Test get command without arguments (error case)
   - Test track command with valid order ID
   - Test track command without arguments (error case)
   - Test history command
   - Test history command with year flag
   - Test history command with format flag
   - Test command structure (all subcommands registered)
   - Test list command flags exist
   - Test history command flags exist

#### Implementation Details:

- Used Cobra library for CLI framework as specified in PRD
- Followed the exact command structure and flags defined in Phase 3.3 of the PRD
- All commands currently return placeholder JSON responses with TODOs for actual implementation
- Commands are ready to integrate with `internal/amazon/orders.go` once the backend API client is implemented
- All commands properly validate arguments (using cobra.ExactArgs(1) where needed)
- Flags are properly typed (IntP, StringP) with sensible defaults

#### Next Steps:

- These commands are ready but need the backend implementation in `internal/amazon/orders.go`
- Need to implement data models in `pkg/models/order.go`
- Need to integrate with the output system from `internal/output/output.go`
- Commands need to be registered with the root command in `cmd/root.go`

#### Files Created:
- cmd/orders.go (113 lines)
- cmd/orders_test.go (188 lines)
