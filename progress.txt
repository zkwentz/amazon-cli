## Completed Tasks

### UpdateFrequency Method Implementation

**Files Created:**
1. pkg/models/subscription.go - Created subscription data models
   - Subscription struct with all required fields (SubscriptionID, ASIN, Title, Price, DiscountPercent, FrequencyWeeks, NextDelivery, Status, Quantity)
   - SubscriptionsResponse struct for list operations
   - UpcomingDelivery struct for upcoming deliveries

2. internal/amazon/subscriptions.go - Implemented subscription management methods
   - GetSubscriptions() - Retrieves all subscriptions
   - GetSubscription(subscriptionID) - Gets a specific subscription
   - SkipDelivery(subscriptionID) - Skips next delivery
   - UpdateFrequency(subscriptionID, weeks) - Updates delivery frequency (main implementation)
   - CancelSubscription(subscriptionID) - Cancels a subscription
   - GetUpcomingDeliveries() - Gets upcoming deliveries

3. internal/amazon/subscriptions_test.go - Comprehensive test coverage
   - TestUpdateFrequency with 7 test cases covering:
     * Valid frequency updates (1, 8, 26 weeks)
     * Error cases: empty ID, zero/negative weeks, exceeding maximum
     * Validation of frequency change and next delivery date calculation
   - TestGetSubscription with validation tests
   - TestSkipDelivery with delivery date validation
   - TestCancelSubscription with status verification
   - TestGetSubscriptions and TestGetUpcomingDeliveries

**Implementation Details:**
- UpdateFrequency validates input parameters:
  * Ensures subscriptionID is not empty
  * Validates weeks is positive (> 0)
  * Validates weeks does not exceed 26 (6 months maximum)
- Updates subscription frequency and recalculates next delivery date
- Follows existing codebase patterns from cart.go implementation
- Returns updated Subscription struct with new frequency and delivery date

**Test Results:**
All tests pass successfully:
- 7 test cases for UpdateFrequency
- 2 test cases for GetSubscription
- 2 test cases for SkipDelivery
- 2 test cases for CancelSubscription
- Additional tests for list operations
