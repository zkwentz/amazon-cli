## Phase 1.1 - Repository Initialization Progress

### Completed:
- Set up directory structure:
  - Created cmd/ directory for CLI command implementations
  - Created internal/amazon/ directory for Amazon API/scraping client
  - Created internal/config/ directory for configuration management
  - Created internal/output/ directory for output formatting
  - Created internal/ratelimit/ directory for rate limiting logic
  - Created pkg/models/ directory for shared data models

The directory structure now matches the project structure defined in the PRD and is ready for implementing the CLI framework and core functionality.
