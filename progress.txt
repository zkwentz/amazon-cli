## Progress: Create internal/amazon/client.go

### Completed Tasks

1. **Created internal/amazon directory structure**
   - Created `internal/amazon/` directory to house Amazon API client code

2. **Implemented internal/amazon/client.go**
   - Created comprehensive HTTP client for Amazon API interactions
   - Implemented RateLimiter with:
     - Minimum delay enforcement (configurable via RateLimitConfig)
     - Random jitter (0-500ms) to avoid request patterns
     - Exponential backoff for retry attempts (2^n * 1000ms, capped at 60s)
     - Smart retry logic for 429 (rate limited) and 503 (service unavailable) responses
   - Implemented Client with:
     - HTTP client with 30-second timeout
     - Cookie jar for session management
     - User-Agent rotation (12 common browser user agents)
     - Automatic rate limiting on all requests
     - Retry logic with configurable max retries
     - Common HTTP headers (Accept, Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding, etc.)
     - Authorization header support for access tokens
   - Added convenience methods:
     - Get() for GET requests
     - PostForm() for POST requests with form data
   - Thread-safe implementation with proper mutex usage

3. **Created comprehensive test suite (internal/amazon/client_test.go)**
   - TestNewClient: Verifies client initialization
   - TestRateLimiterWait: Validates minimum delay enforcement with jitter
   - TestRateLimiterWaitWithBackoff: Tests exponential backoff at different attempt levels
   - TestRateLimiterShouldRetry: Verifies retry logic for different status codes
   - TestClientUserAgentRotation: Confirms user agent rotation works correctly
   - TestClientDoSuccess: Tests successful request execution
   - TestClientDoRetry: Validates retry behavior on 429/503 responses
   - TestClientDoMaxRetries: Ensures max retry limit is respected
   - TestClientDoNoRetryOn404: Confirms non-retryable status codes don't retry
   - TestClientAuthHeader: Verifies authorization header is set correctly
   - BenchmarkClientDo: Performance benchmark for request execution
   - All tests pass successfully (83.9s total runtime)

4. **Initialized Go module**
   - Created go.mod with module path: github.com/zkwentz/amazon-cli

### Implementation Details

**Key Features:**
- Rate limiting with configurable delays prevents triggering Amazon's anti-automation measures
- Exponential backoff automatically handles transient failures
- User-Agent rotation helps avoid detection
- Thread-safe design allows concurrent usage
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability

**Files Created:**
- internal/amazon/client.go (235 lines)
- internal/amazon/client_test.go (340+ lines)
- go.mod

**Next Steps (for future implementation):**
- The client is ready to be used by other Amazon API modules (auth.go, orders.go, returns.go, etc.)
- Configuration can be loaded from ~/.amazon-cli/config.json once config module is implemented
- Authentication tokens can be added via the Config.Auth fields
