## Completed Tasks

### Implement WaitWithBackoff(attempt int) error

**What was implemented:**
1. Created the internal/ratelimit package with limiter.go
2. Implemented the RateLimiter struct with configuration support
3. Implemented WaitWithBackoff(attempt int) error function with:
   - Exponential backoff calculation: 2^attempt * 1000ms
   - Maximum backoff cap at 60 seconds (60000ms)
   - Input validation for negative attempts
   - Updates lastRequestTime after waiting
   - Verbose logging support for debugging
4. Also implemented supporting methods:
   - NewRateLimiter: Creates a new rate limiter instance
   - Wait: Implements minimum delay with random jitter
   - ShouldRetry: Determines if a request should be retried based on status code
   - SetVerbose: Enables/disables verbose logging
5. Created comprehensive tests in limiter_test.go covering:
   - All exponential backoff scenarios (attempt 0-10)
   - Backoff cap at 60 seconds
   - Negative attempt error handling
   - lastRequestTime updates
   - ShouldRetry logic for different status codes
   - Wait function with jitter
   - RateLimiter initialization
6. Created internal/config package with configuration structures
7. All tests pass successfully (184 seconds of test time)

- TestWaitWithBackoff_NegativeAttempt: PASS - validates error handling
- TestWaitWithBackoff_UpdatesLastRequestTime: PASS - validates state updates
- TestShouldRetry: PASS - validates retry logic
- TestWait: PASS - validates basic rate limiting with jitter
- TestNewRateLimiter: PASS - validates initialization
- TestSetVerbose: PASS - validates verbose mode toggle
