## Implemented Features

### Subscriptions Cancel Command
- Created subscription data models in `pkg/models/subscription.go`
  - Subscription struct with all required fields (ID, ASIN, title, price, discount, frequency, next delivery, status, quantity)
  - SubscriptionsResponse struct for listing subscriptions
  - UpcomingDelivery struct for upcoming deliveries

- Implemented subscriptions API client in `internal/amazon/subscriptions.go`
  - GetSubscriptions() - retrieves all Subscribe & Save subscriptions
  - GetSubscription(subscriptionID) - retrieves a specific subscription
  - SkipDelivery(subscriptionID) - skips next delivery
  - UpdateFrequency(subscriptionID, weeks) - changes delivery frequency
  - CancelSubscription(subscriptionID) - cancels a subscription
  - GetUpcomingDeliveries() - retrieves all upcoming deliveries

- Created subscriptions CLI commands in `cmd/subscriptions.go`
  - `subscriptions list` - lists all subscriptions
  - `subscriptions get <subscription-id>` - gets subscription details
  - `subscriptions skip <subscription-id>` - skips next delivery (requires --confirm)
  - `subscriptions frequency <subscription-id> --interval <weeks>` - changes frequency (requires --confirm)
  - `subscriptions cancel <subscription-id>` - cancels subscription (requires --confirm)
  - `subscriptions upcoming` - shows upcoming deliveries

- Comprehensive test coverage in `internal/amazon/subscriptions_test.go`
  - Tests for GetSubscriptions, GetSubscription, SkipDelivery
  - Tests for UpdateFrequency with validation (1-26 weeks)
  - Tests for CancelSubscription including status change verification
  - Tests for GetUpcomingDeliveries
  - All tests passing (17 test cases)

- Safety features
  - `--confirm` flag required for destructive operations (skip, frequency change, cancel)
  - Dry run mode shows what would happen without --confirm
  - Input validation (empty IDs, invalid frequency ranges)
  - Proper error handling with descriptive messages

- All subscription commands output JSON for AI agent integration
- Commands follow the same pattern as existing cart commands
